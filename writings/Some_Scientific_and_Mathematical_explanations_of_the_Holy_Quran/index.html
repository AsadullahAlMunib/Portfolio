                The Quran is Allah's greatest blessing to us.  It contains
                solutions to all of humanity's issues, including business,
                education, society, and family, as well as science.  If one
                carefully examines the words and sentences of the entire Quran, they
                will discover far more than they may think.  As humanity advances in
                knowledge and science, we discover the Quran to be superior in many
                ways.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-tint"></i> Water provides the foundation for Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Water is a necessary ingredient for human survival.  Water
                    is necessary for life to exist.  Since the invention of the
                    microscope, advances in biology have been rapid.  This
                    teaches us that the body is made up of many cells, and the
                    cytoplasm is one of the cells' most important organelles.
                    Water accounts for 80 percent of the cytoplasm's volume.
                    That is, the majority of the body's makeup is water.
                </p>
                <p>This truth has been revealed in the Quran long ago, where Allah Almighty states:</p>
                
                <div class="arabic">وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِنْ مَاءٍ</div>
                
                <p class="translation">"'And Allah created every living creature from water."</p>
                
                <p class="explanation">
                    Allah Almighty explains through this Quran that water is the
                    vital ingredient of life.  Blood is made up of 45% red blood
                    cells and 55% plasma, the majority of which is water
                    (91-92%).

                <h2><i class="fas fa-magnet"></i> Iron</h2>
                <p>
                    Iron is a very vital and robust metal for building our homes
                    and for a variety of other applications.  Surprisingly, iron
                    is not a naturally occurring metal on Earth; rather, it has
                    come from somewhere else in the universe.
                </p>
                <p>In the Holy Quran, Almighty Allah mentions regarding iron on Earth:</p>
                
                <div class="arabic">وَ أَنْزَلْنَا الْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ وَ مَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ</div>
                
                <p class="translation">"And I have sent down iron, in which there is great strength and benefits for mankind." (Surah Al-Hadid: 25)</p>
                
                <p class="explanation">
                    We've all heard of the Big Bang theory, which outlines the
                    universe's origins. In October 2013, the Kelvie Institute of
                    Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (K.I.P.A.C.) and
                    Stanford University's Department of Energy conducted a
                    cooperative research project to discover how iron is
                    created.  Their research article stated that roughly 10
                    billion years ago, a massive collision between cluster
                    galaxies resulted in iron being distributed throughout all
                    galaxies.  Furthermore, huge meteorite impacts caused the
                    formation of iron on Earth.

                <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Mathematically,</h3>
                <p>
                    the word <span class="arabic-sm">حديد</span> in Arabic means 'iron', and the name of the
                    57th surah in the Holy Quran is <span class="arabic-sm">حديد</span> or 'Iron'. We are well
                    aware that the Holy Quran has 114 surahs; dividing this
                    number by two yields 57, indicating that the surah in the
                    center of the Holy Quran is known as 'Iron'. When we look at
                    the Earth's core, we can see that iron makes up 80% of its
                    composition.
                </p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">In terms of Chemistry,</h3>
                <p>
                    Where do we find iron? How does the word <span class="arabic-sm">حديد</span> mentioned in
                    the Quran align with this? Can you imagine? If we look at
                    the periodic table of elements, we see that the atomic
                    number of iron (Fe) is 26. Now, if we calculate the value of
                    the Arabic letters in the word <span class="arabic-sm">حديد</span> according to their
                    Literal Values, we find that the literal value of <span class="arabic-sm">ح</span> is 8;
                    <span class="arabic-sm">د</span> is 4; <span class="arabic-sm">ي</span> is 10; and again <span class="arabic-sm">د</span> is 4.
                    Here, 8 + 4 + 10 +
                    4 equals 26, which perfectly matches the atomic number of
                    iron (Fe).

                <p class="explanation">
                    The information describing the 'expanding of the cosmos' is
                    recognized as one of the major breakthroughs in the
                    advancement of space science over the previous century. The
                    renowned scientist Stephen Hawking stated in his book 'The
                    Brief History of Time' that 'The discovery of the expansion
                    of the universe is one of the most significant discoveries
                    of the twentieth century.'

                        <p>
                            The Holy Quran mentions the phrase 'Land' 13
                            times, while 'Sea' appears 32 times.  At first
                            glance, this may not appear to be significant.
                            However, adding 13 and 32 results in a total of 45.
                            When computing percentages, 13 equals 28.88%, while
                            32 equals 71.11%.  Do you understand this?  In other
                            words, scientists calculated a few years ago that
                            land makes up 28.88% of the Earth's total surface,
                            while water makes up 71.11%.

                            In the Holy Quran, the word 'Man' is mentioned 23
                            times, and the word 'Woman' is also mentioned 23
                            times. This demonstrates that Allah Almighty has
                            granted equal and just rights through Islam.
                            Furthermore, adding these two integers yields 46.
                            Can you imagine what Allah Almighty is conveying
                            through this?  With developments in biology, we now
                            know that a human kid is born with 46 chromosomes,
                            23 from the mother and the remaining 23 from the father.

                            The term 'Punishment' occurs 117 times in the Holy

                            when 117 is multiplied by 2, it equals 234.  This
                            means that Almighty Allah forgives twice as much as
                            He punishes.  Through this, He reveals His mercy and compassion.

                            The word 'Rich' appears 26 times in the Holy
                            Quran, and the word 'Poor' appears 13 times, where
                            13 is half of 26. Additionally, the word 'Zakat'
                            appears the same number of times as the word
                            'Blessing'. This illustrates the greater benefits
                            associated with the giving of zakat, encouraging
                            everyone to give zakat.
